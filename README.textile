h1. Github-alike Style

I"m a big fan of Github's styling and wanted to use something similar in my own internal projects. 

I'm not using their CSS directly, I recreated it in Pixelmator and converted to CSS.

It's similar, but not exactly the same.

I'm using this for internal projects and don't advocate anyone using it for any purpose or reason (I just wanted somewhere to keep a copy). Launch a public site using this at your own risk (of being sued by github.com)!
